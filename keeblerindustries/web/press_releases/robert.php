            <h1>Keebler Industries Int'l Assoc. has determined that Robert Liam Fahie has breached our Core Principles and we will be hereby denouncing all of his further actions.</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Robert Liam Fahie, for far too long, has continously offended many employees of this company, including, but not limited to: Luciano Xavier Pomara, James Frederick
                Sears, and Keebler James 17. Robert Liam Fahie is the antithesis of our company, and we here at Keebler Industries firmly believe we should mass report his Twitter
                account. We have some specific grievences:<br>
                <ol>
                    <li>His Discord status SUCKS</li>
                    <li>His Terraria world SUCKS</li>
                    <li>He SUCKS at python</li>
                </ol>
                Due to these reasons, we have decided to terminate the employee. You may email him hate mail at: <a href="mailto:robbie@keeblerindustries.com">robbie@keeblerindustries.com</a>
                <br><br>
                Thank you,
                <br>
                Keebler Industries Team
